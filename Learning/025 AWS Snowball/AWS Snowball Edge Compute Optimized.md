# ✅ **Use Cases for Snowball Edge Compute Optimized**

1. **Edge Machine Learning Inference and Data Analysis**  
   - Run ML models and analytics locally where connectivity is limited (e.g., manufacturing plants, mines, remote research stations).

2. **Local Processing of Video, Image, or Sensor Data**  
   - Analyze video streams (e.g., security surveillance), medical imaging, or industrial sensor data at the edge before syncing results to the cloud.

3. **IoT Applications at the Edge**  
   - Collect, filter, and respond to data from thousands of IoT devices in near real-time without round-tripping to AWS cloud.

4. **Military and Tactical Field Operations**  
   - Perform mission-critical workloads like geospatial analysis, real-time communication, or data fusion securely in disconnected environments.
