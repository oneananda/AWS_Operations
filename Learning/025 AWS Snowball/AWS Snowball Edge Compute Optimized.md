# ✅ **Use Cases for Snowball Edge Compute Optimized**

1. **Edge Machine Learning Inference and Data Analysis**  
   - Run ML models and analytics locally where connectivity is limited (e.g., manufacturing plants, mines, remote research stations).

2. **Local Processing of Video, Image, or Sensor Data**  
   - Analyze video streams (e.g., security surveillance), medical imaging, or industrial sensor data at the edge before syncing results to the cloud.

3. **IoT Applications at the Edge**  
   - Collect, filter, and respond to data from thousands of IoT devices in near real-time without round-tripping to AWS cloud.

4. **Military and Tactical Field Operations**  
   - Perform mission-critical workloads like geospatial analysis, real-time communication, or data fusion securely in disconnected environments.

5. **Healthcare Imaging and Diagnostics in Remote Areas**  
   - Run diagnostic applications and image processing on-premises (e.g., MRI, CT scans) before uploading data to AWS.

6. **Temporary Edge Datacenters**  
   - Stand up a powerful temporary datacenter with compute and storage capabilities in locations like offshore rigs, ships, or mobile labs.

7. **Disaster Recovery Operations**  
   - Use the device as a portable recovery solution with compute capacity to restore services quickly in disconnected or damaged environments.

8. **Machine Vision and Automation in Manufacturing**  
   - Deploy computer vision applications for defect detection, safety monitoring, and automation directly on the production floor.
