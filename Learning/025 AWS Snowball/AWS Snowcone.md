# ✅ **Use Cases for AWS Snowcone**

1. **Edge Computing in Remote or Harsh Environments**  
   - Deploy in locations with limited or no connectivity (e.g., oil rigs, military bases, ships).
   - Run local applications and process data close to the source before syncing with AWS.

2. **Data Collection in the Field**  
   - Capture and store data from IoT devices, drones, or remote sensors in environments like construction sites, farms, or wildlife areas.

3. **Portable Data Transfer**  
   - Physically transfer small amounts of data (up to 8 TB) to AWS when network bandwidth is limited or unavailable.

4. **Disaster Response and Emergency Situations**  
   - Use Snowcone to deploy quickly for connectivity, local computing, and data collection during natural disasters or field emergencies.

5. **Healthcare and Clinical Trials**  
   - Collect and process data securely in remote clinics or labs where connectivity is poor but secure data handling is required.

6. **Media and Entertainment**  
   - Record and pre-process footage on-site (e.g., during film shoots) and later transfer data to AWS for post-production.

7. **Mobile Command Centers**  
   - Provide compute and storage at mobile sites like vehicles or field operation centers with secure, ruggedized hardware.
