| **Automation**          | Automates complex operational tasks using predefined or custom workflows (runbooks).            | Creating backups, managing AMIs, and instance provisioning.                                  |
| **Patch Manager**       | Automates patching for operating systems and applications.                                      | Ensuring compliance by applying updates to EC2 and on-premises servers.                      |
| **Inventory**           | Collects and tracks metadata about managed instances.                                           | Monitoring software versions, licenses, and configurations.                                  |
| **Compliance**          | Monitors and evaluates resource compliance against defined policies.                            | Ensuring adherence to security and configuration standards.                                  |
| **State Manager**       | Ensures instances maintain a desired state.                                                     | Configuring software installations or scheduled tasks.                                       |

### **Use Case: Automating Patch Management with AWS Systems Manager**

**Scenario**:  
A company wants to ensure that all its EC2 instances (both Linux and Windows) are up to date with the latest security patches to maintain compliance and reduce vulnerabilities. They need an automated, scalable, and repeatable solution.

---

**Steps**:

1. **Set Up SSM Agent**:
   - Ensure the SSM Agent is installed and running on all EC2 instances.
   - Assign an IAM role with necessary permissions (`AmazonSSMFullAccess` or custom policy).

2. **Configure Patch Baselines**:
   - Define patch baselines to specify which patches should be applied (e.g., critical security updates).
   - AWS provides pre-defined baselines, but you can create custom ones to suit your compliance needs.

3. **Create a Maintenance Window**:
   - Schedule a maintenance window for patching to ensure minimal disruption.
   - Example: Every Sunday at 2:00 AM.

4. **Use Patch Manager**:
   - Define a **Patch Group** to categorize instances that require similar patching schedules.
   - Configure **Patch Manager** to scan and install patches during the maintenance window.

5. **Monitor Patch Compliance**:
   - Use **Compliance** and **Inventory** components to track which patches were applied and identify any missing patches.
   - Generate reports for audits or compliance verification.

6. **Notifications and Logs**:
   - Integrate with **Amazon CloudWatch** and **AWS SNS** to send notifications for patching status.
   - Store logs of the patching process in **Amazon S3** for future analysis.
