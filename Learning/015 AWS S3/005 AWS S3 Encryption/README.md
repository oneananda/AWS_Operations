# AWS S3 Encryption

**SSE** (Server-Side Encryption) and **CSE** (Client-Side Encryption) are two methods for encrypting data, particularly when dealing with storage services like Amazon S3. 

### 1. **SSE (Server-Side Encryption)**:
   **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)** refers to encryption that is performed on the server side before the data is stored. AWS handles the encryption, key management, and decryption process, simplifying encryption for the user.
