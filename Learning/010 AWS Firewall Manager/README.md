# AWS Firewall Manager

AWS Firewall Manager is like the central command center for your AWS security needs. Imagine you’re managing security across multiple AWS accounts—maybe you’re dealing with different teams, projects, or even entire departments. Keeping all of them secure and compliant with your organization’s security policies can get complicated and time-consuming. That’s where AWS Firewall Manager steps in.

### What AWS Firewall Manager Does:

1. **One-Stop Security Management**: Instead of manually setting up security rules for each account or resource, Firewall Manager lets you create and enforce rules from a single place. Think of it like setting up a master control panel for all your AWS firewall needs—be it protecting your web applications, blocking unwanted traffic, or managing network security.

2. **Works with Other AWS Security Tools**: Firewall Manager doesn’t work alone—it plays nicely with other AWS security services like AWS WAF (for web app firewalls), AWS Shield Advanced (for DDoS protection), and AWS Network Firewall (for network-level filtering). It’s like having an integrated security team that covers different aspects of your AWS environment.
