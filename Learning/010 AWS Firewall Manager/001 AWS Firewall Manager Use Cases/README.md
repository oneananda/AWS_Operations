# AWS Firewall Manager Use Cases

### **1. Simplified Web App Security**

Scenario: Imagine you’re running multiple websites across different AWS accounts—some for marketing, others for internal tools. Each site needs protection from hackers trying to exploit weaknesses like injecting malicious code. Manually setting up security rules for each site can be a nightmare.

Solution: AWS Firewall Manager lets you set up web security rules once and apply them across all your sites automatically. It's like setting a blanket policy that covers all your apps, keeping them safe without needing to dig into each one individually.
