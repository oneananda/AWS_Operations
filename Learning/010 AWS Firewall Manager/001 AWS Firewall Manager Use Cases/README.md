# AWS Firewall Manager Use Cases

### **1. Simplified Web App Security**

Scenario: Imagine you’re running multiple websites across different AWS accounts—some for marketing, others for internal tools. Each site needs protection from hackers trying to exploit weaknesses like injecting malicious code. Manually setting up security rules for each site can be a nightmare.

Solution: AWS Firewall Manager lets you set up web security rules once and apply them across all your sites automatically. It's like setting a blanket policy that covers all your apps, keeping them safe without needing to dig into each one individually.


### **2. Automatic Defense Against DDoS Attacks**

Scenario: Let’s say your online store or service is a key part of your business, and you’re worried about DDoS attacks that could knock it offline. Setting up DDoS protection manually for every part of your system can be complex.

Solution: Firewall Manager, together with AWS Shield Advanced, can automatically roll out DDoS protection policies across all your resources. So, you don’t have to scramble every time you scale up or launch something new—your defenses are always on point.
