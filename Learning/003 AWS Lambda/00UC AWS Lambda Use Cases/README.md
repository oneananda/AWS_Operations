# AWS Lambda Use Cases

AWS Lambda allows you to run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration. Simply upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

## Use Cases

### 1. Real-time File Processing

**Description:** Process files such as images, videos, and documents as they are uploaded to Amazon S3.

**Example:** Automatically generate thumbnails for images uploaded to an S3 bucket.

**Example:** RESTful APIs for mobile apps using API Gateway and Lambda.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Trigger: HTTP request via API Gateway.
- Services: AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, DynamoDB for data storage.

### 3. Data Transformation

**Description:** Perform data processing and transformation tasks on data streams in real-time.

**Example:** Transform and store log data from IoT devices for further analysis.

**Implementation Highlights:**

Trigger: Data ingestion from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams or DynamoDB Streams.
Services: AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, DynamoDB, Amazon S3 for data storage.

### 4. Batch Processing

**Description:** Run batch jobs to process large volumes of data efficiently.

**Example:** Perform nightly ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks on large datasets.

**Implementation Highlights:**

Trigger: Scheduled via EventBridge or invoked manually.
Services: AWS Lambda, AWS Glue for ETL jobs, Amazon S3 for data storage.
