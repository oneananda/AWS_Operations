# AWS Lambda Concurrency

`Concurrency` refers to the number of function instances that are serving requests at a given time. Each instance handles one request at a time.

`Concurrent Executions:` Each Lambda function scales automatically by creating more instances when more requests come in. The maximum number of instances that can run simultaneously is determined by concurrency limits.
