## Amazon EC2

**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud. EC2 allows you to launch virtual servers (instances) to run applications, offering flexibility and control over computing resources. Key aspects include selecting AMIs, configuring security groups, and managing instance lifecycles.

## Amazon VPC

**Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** allows you to create an isolated network within AWS, giving you control over network settings like IP ranges, subnets, and route tables. VPCs are essential for securing AWS environments and controlling how your instances connect to the internet and other AWS services.

## AWS Lambda

**AWS Lambda** is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events, automatically managing the compute resources for you. It’s ideal for building scalable, event-driven applications without the need to manage servers, focusing solely on your code.
