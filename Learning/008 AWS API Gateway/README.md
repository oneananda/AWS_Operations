# AWS API Gateway

`AWS API Gateway` is a managed service from `Amazon Web Services` that allows to `create, publish, maintain, and secure APIs` (Application Programming Interfaces) at any scale. Imagine it as a bridge between the users or clients and the backend services we have, like AWS Lambda functions, EC2 instances, or other HTTP endpoints.

Imagine you have a shop, and people want to buy things from you. Instead of letting everyone directly into your shop, you set up a counter outside where someone checks what people want, takes their order, and brings them what they need. This way, your shop stays organized, and you can control who gets what.

`AWS API Gateway` is like that counter for your apps. It sits between the users (or other apps) and your backend services (like servers or databases) and manages all the requests coming in.
