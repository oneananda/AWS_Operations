# EC2 Auto Scaling Lifecycle Hooks

We can perform customized actions whenever the Auto Scaling group scale-out or scale-in the EC2 instances,

For example:

- When any new EC2 instance is being provisioned, we may need to check if all the necessary software is present in the instance.
- Instance Health Validation: Perform additional health checks beyond what’s done by the Auto Scaling group to ensure the new instances meet your application’s specific requirements before they start receiving traffic.
- Use lifecycle hooks to log instance activity or update monitoring dashboards when scaling actions occur, providing better insights into your Auto Scaling group’s behavior.
- For stateful applications, ensure that new instances synchronize necessary data from a central source, such as downloading configuration files, loading initial datasets, or syncing with other services.
