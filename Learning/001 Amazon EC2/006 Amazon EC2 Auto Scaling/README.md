# Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

Scaling in cloud environment involves in the following ways,
- Scale up : Increasing the capablity
- Scale down : Decrease the capablity
- Horizontal Scaling : Adding additional servers / resources, e.g., copying the same set of existing resources
- Vertical Scaling : Adding more space, memory, processing to a single server / resource

## AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Group:

Imagine you're planning a big Indian wedding, and just like any grand event, you need to manage resources efficiently to handle fluctuating guest numbers. AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Groups work similarly to ensure that your application's performance stays consistent, just like making sure your guests are always comfortable and well-fed at the wedding. Let’s break down the components using this analogy:

### Auto Scaling Group (ASG) - The Wedding Planner:

Think of the Auto Scaling Group as your wedding planner. Just as the planner ensures the right number of tables, chairs, and food are available based on the number of guests, the ASG manages the number of EC2 instances to handle your application's demand. It keeps an eye on the crowd (traffic) and adjusts resources accordingly.

### Launch Configuration/Template - The Shopping List:

The launch configuration or template is like your wedding shopping list. It specifies what kind of resources you'll need for each instance, similar to deciding on the type of food, decorations, and seating arrangements. It includes details like instance type, AMI (Amazon Machine Image), security groups, and key pairs—basically, all the specifications to "launch" your event properly.

### Scaling Policies - The Backup Plans:

Scaling policies are like the backup plans the wedding planner has. If more guests show up unexpectedly, the planner knows when to call for extra caterers or get more chairs. Similarly, scaling policies define when to add more EC2 instances (scale out) or reduce them (scale in) based on thresholds like CPU usage, traffic spikes, or other metrics.

### Desired Capacity - The Invited Guests List:

Desired capacity is your ideal guest count—the number of EC2 instances you want running most of the time. Just as you'd plan for a certain number of guests, the ASG maintains this desired count unless the scaling policies trigger adjustments.

### Minimum and Maximum Size - Minimum and Maximum Guests:

This is like setting the minimum and maximum number of guests you’re prepared to handle. The minimum size is the least number of instances you always want running (say, a core group of family members), while the maximum size is the highest you can accommodate (like the upper limit of your banquet hall capacity).

### Scaling Cooldowns - The Break Between Ceremonies:

Cooldowns are like the breaks between different ceremonies or events at a wedding. After a big function, you need a little time to reset before the next one starts, ensuring smooth transitions. In ASGs, cooldown periods give the system time to stabilize after scaling actions before it scales again.

### Health Checks - The Security Guards:

Health checks are like the security guards ensuring only well-behaved guests stay at the party. They regularly check each EC2 instance's status, and if an instance is "misbehaving" (unhealthy), it's replaced—just like escorting a troublesome guest out and bringing in someone who behaves.

Just like your wedding planner ensures the event runs smoothly, an AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Group manages your application's performance and cost, making sure you have the right resources at the right time!

## EC2 Auto Scaling Policies

EC2 Auto Scaling helps you automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances in your application to handle variable loads efficiently. Here's a breakdown of the main types of EC2 Auto Scaling policies explained in a way that's easy to relate to:

## 1. Target Tracking Scaling Policy
   - **What It Is**: Think of this policy like your air conditioner’s thermostat. You set a desired target (like temperature), and it adjusts automatically to maintain that target. In this case, the target could be something like CPU utilization.
   - **How It Works**: You specify a target value for a metric (e.g., keeping CPU utilization at 50%). Auto Scaling will then add or remove instances to keep the metric as close to the target value as possible.
   - **When To Use**: Use this when you want to maintain a consistent performance level, like keeping your application response times stable during fluctuating traffic.

## 2. Step Scaling Policy
   - **What It Is**: Step Scaling is like managing an event where you add more chairs or plates based on the number of guests arriving. It allows you to scale incrementally based on how far your metric deviates from a set threshold.
   - **How It Works**: You define scaling actions based on thresholds. For example, if CPU usage exceeds 60% but is below 80%, you add 2 instances. If it goes beyond 80%, you add 5 instances. This helps manage varying loads with more control.
   - **When To Use**: This is best for situations where demand can vary widely, like sales promotions or peak usage periods, and you need more granular control over scaling actions.

## 3. Scheduled Scaling Policy
   - **What It Is**: Scheduled Scaling is like having a timetable that adjusts the number of resources based on expected usage patterns, much like increasing staff during rush hours in a restaurant.
   - **How It Works**: You set a scaling schedule based on predictable changes in demand, such as increasing instances during business hours and reducing them after hours.
   - **When To Use**: Ideal for applications with predictable traffic patterns, such as peak times during the day or specific days of the week.

## Additional Feature: Predictive Scaling
   - **What It Is**: Predictive Scaling uses machine learning to forecast future traffic and adjusts scaling proactively. It's like knowing in advance that you'll have more visitors and preparing accordingly.
   - **How It Works**: It anticipates the load based on historical data and adjusts the scaling ahead of time to handle expected traffic.

By understanding and applying these EC2 Auto Scaling policies, you can ensure that your application scales efficiently, balancing performance and cost. Choose the policy that best fits your workload needs to optimize your resources with AWS.
