# Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

In a given EC2 instance in Subnet which is in turn present in a VPC the communication between them is handled by ANIs.

ENIs are fundamental to network connectivity for EC2 instances within AWS, an ENI acts as a virtual network card that connects an EC2 instance to the network.

**Detailed Explaination:**

Consider we have 2 VPCs in the same region, `VPC1` and `VPC2`

VPC1 is having 2 subnets `SN1a (Public)`, `SN1b (Private)`

VPC2 is having 2 subnets `SN2a (Public)`, `SN2b (Private)`

ANIs are enabling connection between 

## `SN1a (Public) → Public Network`

ENIs attached to instances in SN1a can connect to the public network (internet) if the subnet has an internet gateway and the ENI has a public IP or is associated with an Elastic IP.

---

## `SN1b (Private) → SN1a (Public)`

ENIs enable communication between subnets within the same VPC. SN1b can communicate with SN1a if the route tables and security groups allow it, and there are no network ACLs blocking the communication.

---

## `SN1b (Private) → SN2a (Public)`

Direct communication between SN1b and SN2a requires VPC peering, a transit gateway, or another type of VPC connectivity (like VPN or AWS PrivateLink). ENIs alone do not directly handle cross-VPC communication.

---

## `SN1b (Private) → SN2b (Private)`

As with the previous point, communication between SN1b and SN2b across different VPCs needs VPC peering or another VPC connection method. ENIs on their own don’t establish cross-VPC connections.

---

## `SN1a (Public) → Any Public Subnet`

ENIs in SN1a can communicate with instances in other public subnets (e.g., SN2a) across VPCs if there is VPC peering, a transit gateway, or another suitable connection established.
