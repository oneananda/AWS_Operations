# Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

In a given EC2 instance in Subnet which is in turn present in a VPC the communication between them is handled by ANIs.

ENIs are fundamental to network connectivity for EC2 instances within AWS, an ENI acts as a virtual network card that connects an EC2 instance to the network.

## `Detailed Example:`

**Consider we have 2 VPCs in the same region, `VPC1` and `VPC2`**

VPC1 is having 2 subnets `SN1a (Public)`, `SN1b (Private)`

VPC2 is having 2 subnets `SN2a (Public)`, `SN2b (Private)`

**ANIs are enabling connection combinations like below** 

## `SN1a (Public) → Public Network`

ENIs attached to instances in SN1a can connect to the public network (internet) if the subnet has an internet gateway and the ENI has a public IP or is associated with an Elastic IP.

---

## `SN1b (Private) → Public Network`

It is possible for instances in a private subnet (like SN1b) to access the public internet, but it requires specific configurations since private subnets do not have a direct route to an Internet Gateway.

We can use either 

- NAT Gateway
- or NAT Instance

**Explaination**

- NAT Gateway in Public Subnet (SN1a): This gateway will handle outgoing internet requests from instances in SN1b.
- Route Table for SN1b: Add a route directing 0.0.0.0/0 to the NAT Gateway.
- Security Groups and Network ACLs: Ensure security group rules allow outbound traffic as required, and network ACLs do not block the necessary connections.

**Limitations:**

Instances in SN1b can initiate outbound connections to the internet, but the internet cannot initiate inbound connections to SN1b, preserving the private nature of the subnet.

---

## `SN1b (Private) → SN1a (Public)`

ENIs enable communication between subnets within the same VPC. SN1b can communicate with SN1a if the route tables and security groups allow it, and there are no network ACLs blocking the communication.

---

## `SN1b (Private) → SN2a (Public)`

Direct communication between SN1b and SN2a requires VPC peering, a transit gateway, or another type of VPC connectivity (like VPN or AWS PrivateLink). ENIs alone do not directly handle cross-VPC communication.

---

## `SN1b (Private) → SN2b (Private)`

As with the previous point, communication between SN1b and SN2b across different VPCs needs VPC peering or another VPC connection method. ENIs on their own don’t establish cross-VPC connections.

---

## `SN1a (Public) → Any Public Subnet`

ENIs in SN1a can communicate with instances in other public subnets (e.g., SN2a) across VPCs if there is VPC peering, a transit gateway, or another suitable connection established.
