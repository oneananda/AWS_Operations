# AWS Operations Learning - Amazon EC2

AWS Operations Learning - `Amazon EC2`, this repo folder provides comprehensive articles related to Amazon EC2 resources.

This repository provides detailed insights into various Amazon EC2 concepts, including instance components, types, purchase options, health checks, placement groups, auto scaling, third-party components, and a demo of EC2 Auto Scaling.

`Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2)` is a computing service from `Amazon Web Services (AWS)`, this is based on virtual machine concept, where users can rent the machines of their needed configuration to work on the computing part, this is categorised as `Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)`

This is one of the earliest services released by Amazon in 2006 after `Simple Storage Services (S3)` and `Simple Queue Service (SQS)` (A message queuing service),

It enables the users to run their application on virtual servers known as instances without need to invest in physical hardware, with EC2 we can scale the resources up and down on need basis, making it to ideal for the business ranging from small to large enterprises.
