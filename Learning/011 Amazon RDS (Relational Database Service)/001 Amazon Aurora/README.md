# Amazon Aurora

`Amazon Aurora` is a cloud-based database service offered by `Amazon Web Services (AWS)`. Think of it as a supercharged version of a traditional database that’s designed to be more reliable, scalable, and easier to manage. It’s like upgrading from a regular car to a high-performance sports car—both get you where you need to go, but the sports car does it faster and with more style.
