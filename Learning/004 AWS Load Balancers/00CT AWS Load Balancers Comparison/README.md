## Detailed Use Case Examples

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
  - **Example:** A SaaS platform with multiple microservices, each responsible for different functions like authentication, payments, and user management. ALB uses path-based routing to direct requests to the appropriate service.
  - **Use Case:** Modern web applications, API gateways, and microservices where detailed application-level routing decisions are needed.

- **Network Load Balancer (NLB):**
  - **Example:** A stock trading application requiring high-speed data processing with minimal latency. NLB manages TCP traffic to backend servers with low latency and high throughput.
  - **Use Case:** High-performance, low-latency applications like real-time bidding platforms, game servers, and applications with static IP requirements.

- **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):**
  - **Example:** A legacy internal web application that needs basic SSL termination and health checks.
  - **Use Case:** Basic HTTP/HTTPS applications with minimal routing needs, existing setups that haven’t yet upgraded to ALB or NLB.

- **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB):**
  - **Example:** A multi-cloud security architecture using third-party firewalls to inspect and secure incoming traffic from on-premises and cloud networks.
  - **Use Case:** Network security appliance scaling, traffic inspection for compliance or security policies, and integration of third-party network services in the cloud.
