# Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform with ALB

## Scenario #1

You are developing a multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to serve multiple clients, each with unique requirements and customization needs. The platform is built on a microservices architecture and uses Amazon ECS for container orchestration. Each tenant has its own set of microservices, including 
- Authentication, 
- User management, 
- Billing, 
- Analytics, 
- And content delivery services. 
 
The platform needs to 
- Handle high traffic volumes, 
- Provide SSL termination, 
- And route requests to the appropriate microservices based on tenant-specific configurations.

**Key Requirements:**

**Multi-Tenant Support:** The platform must distinguish between different tenants and route traffic accordingly. Each tenant's data and services must remain isolated.

**Advanced Routing Capabilities:** The ALB needs to route requests based on 
- Paths, 
- Hostnames, 
- Headers, 
- And query strings 
to direct traffic to the correct microservice.

**Security:** All traffic should be encrypted using SSL/TLS, with the ability to manage multiple SSL certificates for different domains.
