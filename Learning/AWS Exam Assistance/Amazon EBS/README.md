# Amazon EBS Exam Assistance

- EBS volumes are tied to a specific Availability Zone and cannot be shared between instances in different zones. 

### Here’s a question incorporating this logic:

**Question:**

A company is running a critical application on Amazon EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in a region. The company needs to store data persistently and make it available across all instances, but they are currently using Amazon EBS volumes for data storage. However, they have observed that data is not accessible from instances in other AZs.

What should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?

**Options:**
1. Use Amazon S3 for storing data and access it from all instances in different AZs.
2. Create additional EBS volumes in each Availability Zone and replicate data manually across the volumes.
3. Use Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) to store and share data across multiple Availability Zones. (Correct answer)
4. Attach the EBS volume to an EC2 instance in another Availability Zone to share data across all instances.

### Explanation:

- **Option 1:**  
   While **Amazon S3** is a good solution for storing data accessible across AZs, it is primarily used for object storage rather than block storage, which may not be suitable for applications requiring persistent, shared file storage across EC2 instances.

- **Option 2:**  
   Manually replicating data across **EBS volumes** in different AZs is possible, but it is inefficient and requires complex management. **EBS volumes are tied to a specific Availability Zone** and cannot be shared directly between instances in different AZs.

- **Option 3 (Correct):**  
   **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)** is designed for sharing files across instances and Availability Zones. It allows data to be accessible from all EC2 instances in different AZs without manual replication, providing a highly available and scalable solution.

- **Option 4:**  
   **EBS volumes cannot be attached** to EC2 instances in different Availability Zones, so this option is not possible.
