# AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)

`AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)` is a security service from Amazon Web Services designed to safeguard the web applications. Think of it as a protective shield that keeps the website or API safe from common cyber threats like hackers trying to sneak in through vulnerabilities, slow down the site, or overwhelm it with unwanted traffic. AWS WAF watches over incoming web traffic, filtering out any suspicious or harmful requests before they can cause trouble, ensuring the application stays secure, available, and running smoothly.

AWS WAF helps defend against common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP Top 10 security risks.
