# AWS PrivateLink

AWS PrivateLink is a service that allows secure, private connectivity between Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environments, AWS services, and on-premises applications without exposing your traffic to the public internet. It is often used when you want to access services (such as APIs, SaaS applications, or internal services) from your VPC securely.
