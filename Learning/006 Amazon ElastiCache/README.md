# Amazon ElastiCache

Amazon ElastiCache is a fully-managed (by AWS) in memory caching service from AWS,

It provides support for 2 popular in-memory caching engines

- Redis
- Memcached

## Analogy

In a book library, the regular process is, if we want to get a book, we need to go to the shelf and search for it, 

But, if the popular or frequently used books are placed in a center table means, that will be more useful right, the same idealogy applies to Amazon ElastiCache, it is placing the frequently accessed data in a intermediate place called in-memory cache so the accesing time to that is significanlty very high.
