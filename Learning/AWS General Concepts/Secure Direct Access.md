# AWS Access Control: Key Concepts to Secure Direct Access

| **Access Control Mechanism**       | **Applicable To**                       | **Description**                                                                                                     | **When to Use**                                                                                                         |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VPC Endpoints (PrivateLink)**    | DynamoDB, S3, and many other services   | Privately connect your VPC to AWS services without going over the public internet.                                  | When you want to secure internal traffic and avoid exposing services like DynamoDB or S3 to the internet.                |
| **API Gateway + Lambda or VPC**    | DynamoDB, RDS, Lambda, VPC              | Create a secure API as an entry point to AWS services, with fine-grained control over access using Lambda or VPC.    | When you need to expose a database or backend service through a secure and controlled API.                               |
| **IAM Roles and Policies**         | All AWS services                        | Control who can access what by assigning roles and permissions using AWS IAM.                                        | Always use IAM policies to restrict access based on roles, users, or services to ensure secure service interaction.       |
| **S3 Signed URLs**                 | S3                                      | Generate time-limited URLs for temporary access to private S3 objects.                                               | When you want to securely provide temporary access to private S3 content without making it publicly accessible.           |
| **AWS Lambda Authorizers**         | API Gateway                             | Custom authentication for APIs using Lambda functions to verify access before interacting with backend services.     | When you want to control access to your API with custom logic, such as validating JWT tokens or session-based auth.       |
| **AWS Secrets Manager** / **Parameter Store** | Services needing credentials   | Securely store and manage sensitive data like database credentials, API keys, and other secrets for applications.    | When you need a secure way to manage sensitive data for your services, like storing DynamoDB credentials.                 |
| **Amazon Cognito**                 | S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, etc.         | Manage user authentication and permissions with token-based access control for backend services.                     | When you need to manage users and give them secure access to AWS services like S3 or DynamoDB based on their roles.       |
| **CloudFront Signed URLs / Cookies**| S3 (via CloudFront)                    | Control access to CloudFront-distributed content by using time-limited signed URLs or cookies for secure delivery.    | When you need to deliver content via CloudFront and control access at the session or user level with signed credentials.  |
| **AWS Shield / AWS WAF**           | Web applications, APIs, CloudFront      | Protect applications from DDoS attacks (AWS Shield) and block or allow specific traffic patterns (WAF).              | When you want to secure web-facing services, such as API Gateway or CloudFront, from malicious traffic or attacks.        |
| **Resource Policies**              | S3, API Gateway, etc.                   | Fine-tune which AWS accounts, IP addresses, or VPCs can access specific resources directly.                          | When you need resource-level access control to restrict access based on account IDs, IP ranges, or VPC configurations.    |
