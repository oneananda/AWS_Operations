# Origin Access Identity (OAI)

An `Origin Access Identity (OAI)` is a CloudFront feature that ensures only CloudFront can access the origin server.

**Explaination:**

Origin Access Identity (OAI) is a feature of AWS CloudFront that allows you to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket so that the content can only be accessed through CloudFront, not directly from the S3 bucket URL. This helps you control who can view your content and provides additional security by preventing users from bypassing CloudFront and accessing your files directly via S3.
