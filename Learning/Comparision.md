| **AWS Service Catalog**           | Manages approved IT services to ensure compliance with organizational policies.                                             | Focused on catalog management; does not actively monitor or enforce security compliance beyond the initial setup.  | Questions might mislead by suggesting ongoing compliance monitoring; exam scenarios will likely focus on its role in service standardization and governance during the deployment phase, not real-time enforcement.                                                                                                          | Pay-per-use; costs depend on catalog size and usage frequency. | Integrated with AWS services; governance setup can be complex for larger organizations.                           |
| **AWS Organizations**             | Centralized management of multiple AWS accounts with policies for security and compliance.                                  | Limited to AWS accounts; cannot manage security policies or compliance for non-AWS accounts directly.             | Twists may involve scenarios suggesting cross-cloud or on-premises management; questions will often test knowledge of AWS-specific policy management, consolidated billing, and SCP (Service Control Policies).                                                                                                                                           | Free; optional paid features for advanced policies and consolidated billing. | Easy for AWS environments; no direct support for non-AWS environments.                                           |
| **AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)**  | Simplifies sharing of AWS resources across multiple accounts without shared credentials.                                         | Does not provide detailed permission management beyond sharing capabilities; limited to AWS resources.            | Exam questions may twist by implying detailed permissions control or integration with non-AWS resources; expect to differentiate between sharing capabilities and permissions management within AWS accounts.                                                                                                    | Free for most resource sharing; no additional costs.         | Easy within AWS; limited to AWS resources and accounts.                                                           |
