# Kinesis Data Firehose

Kinesis Data Firehose is designed to simplify the process of delivering streaming data to various destinations. It automatically captures and loads streaming data into several popular third-party services, facilitating real-time analytics and monitoring. Supported destinations include:

- **Elasticsearch**: For searching and analyzing log and event data.
- **Splunk**: For advanced data analytics and operational intelligence.
- **Custom HTTP endpoints**: Allowing users to send data to any service that accepts HTTP requests.

Moreover, Kinesis Data Firehose integrates with **AWS Lambda** for data transformation. This enables users to preprocess data on-the-fly, allowing for cleaner, more relevant data to be sent to destination services.
